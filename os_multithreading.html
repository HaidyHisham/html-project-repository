<h3 style="color:red">What is Thread ?</h3>
<p>A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.</p>
<p>A thread shares with its peer threads few information like code segment, data segment and open files. When one thread alters a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.</p>
<p>A thread is also called a lightweight process. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the overhead thread is equivalent to a classical process.</p>
<p>Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control. Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers and web server. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors. The following figure shows the working of a single-threaded and a multithreaded process.</p>

<h4 style="color:red">Advantages of Thread</h4>
<ul>
<li>Threads minimize the context switching time.</li>
<li>Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.</li>
<li>Efficient communication.</li>
<li>It is more economical to create and context switch threads.</li>
<li>Threads allow utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:red">Types of Thread</h4>
<p>Threads are implemented in following two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>User Level Threads −</b> User managed threads.</li>
<li><b>Kernel Level Threads −</b> Operating System managed threads acting on kernel, an operating system core.</li>
</ul>
